This Weather Dashboard is a responsive web application built using React JS and the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to search for current weather conditions in any city worldwide. The app fetches real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, and displays it in a clean and user-friendly interface. It also shows weather icons and dynamically updates the background based on weather conditions. Built with functional components and React hooks, the application ensures smooth rendering and efficient state management. The use of Axios enables fast and secure API calls, while Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS) provides a modern and responsive design.
